The handbook contains information about the module, including its aims, learning outcomes, assessment details, and schedule. You can access it via either the HTML or PDF format. If using the HTML format, you can navigate through the handbook using the sidebar on the left. The PDF version is available for download from Canvas.\nI recognise that as Biology or Zoology undergraduates, you may not have a strong background in statistics. Therefore, I have designed the module to be accessible to all students, regardless of their prior knowledge. The module will provide you with the necessary statistical skills to design and analyse experiments effectively. Each week you will be expected to undertake a small amount of reading, view a short video and use an interactive website to ensure you understand the concepts. The module will also include practical sessions where you will apply the statistical techniques learned in lectures to real data sets.",

    "text": "This document provides you with the aims and rationale behind the course, explains its mode of delivery, staff roles, and forms of assessment. More importantly, it explains the underlying philosophy used to teach experimental design and statistics, which will probably differ from most that you may have previously encountered, or seen in textbooks. A common approach is to provide students with a plethora of different statistical tests that they may or may not need to apply to their data, depending on how they collected their data, the aims and objectives of their experiment etc. This can be very confusing, resulting in bafflement (that was my experience as an undergraduate) with the result that some UG textbooks provide complex flowcharts to help students select the appropriate test.\nA second challenge is the type of software used to undertake statistics. I am (just) old enough to remember doing some basic statistical tests with a calculator which would take a whole afternoon, even with a relatively small sample size. The arrival of computers to take the tedium out of this was a great relief. Most software commonly used for statistics, such as Microsoft Excel, Minitab and SPSS are menu-driven, making it easy to get started with data analysis and graph display. However, whilst their learning curve is initially very shallow, it soon becomes steep. Biological data is inherently complex, and often the more advanced analyses or data visualisations are difficult or impossible to undertake. An additional problem is that you have no record of what you have done. You will be taking this course in October to December of your Stage 2, but many of the skills you will learn will not be practiced in full until you are doing Stage 3 courses and projects. If you do not need to do much statistics after completing this NES2303 course, will you remember what you need in 18 months’ time for your Final Year Project or other experiments/surveys? If you have menu-driven software, it is easy to learn, but easy to forget. In contrast, we will use a coding language that is now common in Biology and Zoology, called R. It is (slightly) harder to learn than menu-driven software, but you don’t forget it, even 12 months later! Many careers in biology and zoology, both laboratory and field-based, expect applicants to know how to use R. We have therefore developed this course to give you the best employability skills for your CV as well.\nFinally, this is the third year in which I have taught on this course and it is updated each year to try and improve it based on your feedback. The main changes this year is to add an additional initial practical to help you learn how to configure and ‘navigate’ the software we’ll use. This will hopefully ensure that in the subsequent practicals you can focus on data science for biologists and zoologists, and not worry about IT. Passive learning in lectures is not particularly useful for quantitative biologists and zoologists like yourselves, and hands-on experience is more useful, so additional practicals are always valuable. If you find yourself making excellent progress, do not feel obliged to attend every practical; however repeating some exercises will embed your knowledge. Also understanding is key: getting the ‘right’ answer from an analysis is not sufficient. You need to know how to interpret its biological meaning.\nPlease provide feedback (positive or negative) as you progress through NES2303 either directly to me as course leader, or to your student representative; name(s) of student reps will be shared as soon as available.",

    "text": "2.1 Cause and effect\nTo some extent the above heading would be a better title for this course than “Experimental Design and Statistics”. Some of you, especially those focussed on cell and molecular biology and / or working in the laboratories are likely to be conducting formal experiments. Others, especially those collecting ecological / environmental data, might be undertaking more survey-work, but this will still be formalised such that it can be analysed and inferences drawn. There are a wide range of experimental and survey designs available, but what they all have in common is the aim to separate the signal from the noise. By “signal” we are talking about questions such as ’Does this antibiotic kill MRSA bacteria?” or “Does low-fertiliser input result in more insect species?” etc. In other words, the biological question that you really want to address and answer.\nBiological data are inherently noisy: if you repeat the same experiment twice you will obtain similar, but not identical results. Some biological systems, such as ecological ones, are noisier than laboratory ones, but even in the latter sample contamination, temperature variations etc. will result in slightly different results. All good experimental / survey designs have the aim of allowing you to work out where the noise in your system is coming from. If you can reduce, or understand, the noise you are more likely to be able to look at the signal which is what you are really interested in.\nWhen you undertake an experiment or survey, you will often be interested in knowing what effect a particular treatment, management regime etc. has on an outcome. For example:\nFor some of these questions it is easy to see how you might design an experiment or survey to answer your question, whereas for others it is harder. What they all haven in common is an underlying assumption about cause and effect, which are often referred to as independent and dependent variables, or explanatory and response variables. So for the above examples, we can view them as:\nIn some of these examples your response (dependent) variable is continuous, with numbers that contain decimal points (bird diversity, wheat yield), in some the response is a whole number (3 days isolation, 7 days, 12 days etc.), and others a value between 0 and 100 (% peak photosynthesis). Likewise sometimes the explanatory (independent) variables have two categories (coppice, covid test), some multiple categories (Azole and SDHI) whilst others are continuous (Fe concentration). Three of the examples (bird, isolation and photosynthesis) only have one explanatory variable, whereas the fourth (wheat) has two explanatory variables. In the last example, the response variable is binary (dead or alive aphids).\nIrrespective of the exact type of data, all the above examples have the same pattern of:\nin other words we are trying to determine whether the explanatory variable(s) are or are not changing the response variable. However, we have already stated that biological data is noisy, and the noisier the data the harder it becomes to determine cause and effect. Therefore, we need to expand our previous equation to:\nWe don’t know what causes this noise, although we can often have a good guess. In this course we will consider simple experimental designs that help explain some of the noise, allowing you to focus more on what your explanatory variables are doing. This noise is more usually referred to as “Residual Error” or simply “Error” : this is not to imply that you have done something wrong, merely that we do not know where the variation has come from, and we need to account for it.\nThe majority of the statistical models that we create in this course will have this syntax of a response variable and one or more explanatory variables, with residual error that is quantified. Formally, this can be written as:\n\\[Y = X + \\epsilon\\]\nwhere",

For example, the number of diagnosed brain tumours in different States in the USA is strongly correlated with the number of mobile phone users in each State. Does that imply that you should throw your Android and iPhones in the bin? No. Think about it for a moment: what matters is the number of brain tumours per capita. Once you take the size of the population of each State into account the correlation disappears. No need to panic!\nThis is a trivial example, but I include it simply to emphasise that you are first and foremost biologists. You must always ask whether the question you are asking makes biological sense, and not blindly accept some numbers generated by a computer.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "One approach we will try and use as much as possible is to think in terms of the goal that you are trying to score. By a goal, we could be referring to a particular graph or plot to visualise your data, a way of tabulating a summary of your data, or undertaking a statistical model. Broadly, your thinking can be along the lines of:\n \n\ngoal ( y ~ x, data = mydata, … )\n\n \nLet’s decode this little diagram:\n\ngoal This can be a plot, such as a barchart, scatterplot, boxplot etc. It could be a statistical test, it might be a simple summary statistic, for example an average (mean), or standard deviation (sd), or it might be a statistical model, such as a linear model (lm) or generalised linear model (glm). All these will be introduced to you during the course.\ny ~ x This represents the \\(Y = X\\) in the equation earlier. For some graphs or simple statistics you might only need the \\(Y\\) component. For example, if you the average overall bird diversity across all your sites, you would just provide the \\(Y\\) data of bird diversity at each wood. If you want the average broken down for both coppiced and uncoppiced woodlands, you would provide both the \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) data. Note that you do not actually need to put \\(+ \\epsilon\\) as this is calculated for you where needed.\ndata = mydata Obviously you will be working with data. Often you need to pre-process your data before you can achieve your goal, and we will teach you simple tricks to do this.\n… This represents additional options. For graphs, you might want to change colours, titles etc. In statistical models, some assumptions may need to be changed when you work with deal with count data (e.g. days after Covid19), bounded data (e.g. % photosynthesis efficiency), or presence / absence data (e.g. dead or alive aphids).",

    "section": "\n4.2 Visualise the data",
    "text": "4.2 Visualise the data\nMy advice for a good starting point is not to begin with data analysis, and instead to visualise your results: this gives you a good initial understanding of what’s happening. Here are two possible scenarios, given that both Biology and Zoology students do the module, and some of you will be focussed on laboratory experiments, and others amongst you field-based studies:\n\n\nLaboratory example You’ve just done a laboratory experiment into cell growth for a bioreactor. Your response is methane production and you have one explanatory variable with two ‘levels’, a conventional feedstock (control), and a new bioreactor feedstock;\n\nField example You’ve just done a field survey of birds. Your response is the number of birds seen in a given area, and you have one explanatory variable with two ‘levels’, a conventional habitat management (control), and a new wildflower management technique.\n\nFor both examples you can visualise the data using a “boxplot” which shows the median, interquartile range, and outliers. The boxplot is a good way to visualise the data because it shows the distribution of the data, and allows you to see if there are any outliers. In the boxplot below the horizontal (x) axis shows the explanatory variable (bioreactor feedstock or field management), and the vertical (y) axis shows the response variable (methane production or number of birds seen).\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot of lab experiment or field survey\n\n\n\nWell that looks fairly obvious: your new bioreactor feedstock or wildflower field management treatment is having the positive effect you hoped for. The median, shown by the horizontal line in each box, is roughly 150 for the control, and roughly 170 for your new treatment. Yes, there is a bit of noise in the data, but the differences are still clear. You can think of this example as:\n\nMethane or birds = Treatment + noise\n\nYour response is of course methane production or bird diversity. The signal from your treatment (feedstock type or field management) on your response is much more important than the random noise, as shown by the bigger box, so it is still obvious what is going on in your graph. Thus, when measuring the signal to noise ratio the signal from your treatment is much bigger than the unexplained random noise, so you will have a big signal to noise ratio. This is a good situation to be in, and you can be confident that your treatment is having an effect.",

    "text": "4.3 Noisier data\nBut what if you had obtained a graph like this?\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot of lab experiment or field survey with more noise\n\n\n\nThe control is still at about 150, and the new treatment still around 170. But the random noise is much bigger, as shown by the much bigger boxes and whiskers. Indeed, on the first graph the vertical axis only goes from 130 to 180, whereas here it goes from 0 to 300 to encompass the much noisier data. You can think of this as:\n\nMethane or birds = Treatment + noise\n\nWhilst the signal from your treatment (feedstock type or field management) still has a big box, the random noise has become much worse, making it harder to understand. Thus, whilst a visual assessment of your data is useful when you have clear differences, you need more powerful methods when the data are noisy. These formal methods of data analysis are what you’ll learn in this module, and they’ll allow you to determine whether the differences you see in your data are statistically significant, or whether they could have occurred by chance. Most of these methods work by assessing the signal to noise ratio in your data, to help you decide if the differences are real. In this second example, the signal to noise ratio is much smaller, meaning that the differences you see could be due to random variation rather than a real effect of your treatment.\nI’ve used an example here with a categorical explanatory variable (feedstock or field management), but the same principles apply to continuous explanatory variables, such as temperature or time. The key point is that you need to assess the signal to noise ratio in your data to determine whether the differences you see are real or just due to random variation.",

If you are dealing with genomic or bioinformatic data, you might have thousands of gene sequences that you want to understand. If you do surveys of plants, birds or insects you may have large numbers of species. It is not correct to do hundreds of separate (g)lms on these data, but multivariate techniques (MVT) provide an effective way to help you interpret them. In this section we introduce you to unconstrained ordination, which allows you to visualise relationships amongst your data.

    "text": "8.1 Why R rather than Excel, Minitab or SPSS?\nYou will use free software called R/RStudio in this course. R was originally designed as a free version as a purely statistical commercial package (called S), and over the last 20 years has become the most popular analytical modelling software used by biologists in academia and industry. A huge number of free online training resources are available, and people have written what are known as ‘packages’ to provide extra functionality. These include data analysis in bioinformatics, ecology, zoology, animal tracking, genomics etc. We will make extensive use of two R packages: mosaic and ggformula. The mosaic package eases the transition for university students to use a code-based data science system like RStudio. gg_formula allows you to build complex graphs, using a series of simple commands.\nThe R software, and mosaic and ggformula packages, are pre-installed on University NUIT cluster-rooms. They can also be used on your own PC or MacBook but due to technical differences between makes / models we will not provide you with any support with these.\nCommercial packages such as Excel, Minitab and SPSS have a “shallow” initial learning curve, as they are based on familiar point-and-click menu-driven systems. R is much tougher initially, as you have to type in commands to, for example, calculage a mean or standard deviation, display a graph etc. However, R has several big advantages:",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many of the skills you learn in NES2303 will be essential for your Stage 3 research or literature review projects. This is not just your computer and analytical skills, but also critical thinking and problem solving. Indeed, a not uncommon conversation between academic staff and students when scoping their projects is along the lines of:\n\nStudent: I’d like to do a project on badgers / DNA / bacteria / phylogeny (delete as applicable)\n\n\nStaff: What exactly do you want to find out about badgers / DNA / bacteria / phylogeny?\n\n\nStudent: I’m really interested in them!\n\n\nStaff: But what is the research question?\n\nAs you progress through the rest of Stage 2, and especially in Stage 3, you will find that you are designing more experiments and surveys yourself, rather than being given a laboratory manual or field guide to follow like a cookery recipe. This, of course, is what real scientific research is like: there isn’t an absent-minded academic stood nearby to tell you exactly what to do. You need to be able to deconstruct what you plan to do, in order to create a sensible, practical experiment or survey, that provide data of sufficient quality for you to interpret.\nWhen Stage 3 students approach me wanting to do a research project under my supervision, a common starting point is them saying something along the lines of “I want to do a research project on butterflies”, or “I’m interested in pollinator conservation”, or “I want to follow a career in mammal conservation”. These might be valid statements, but my immediate response is to ask “What is the question?”, in other words, “What is it specifically that you want to determine?”. So, taking those examples, it would be better to have something along the lines of:\n\nAre the numbers of butterflies higher in roadside verges where the vegetation is cut monthly compared to once per year?\nDo bumblebees occur more frequently near fields of mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape?\nIs the frequency of small mammals detected in camera traps associated with supplementary feed for game birds?\n\nIt is only when the students’ initial statements are re-phrased into questions that we can start to sketch out possible routes by which you can develop formal scientific hypotheses to test with your statistical model, develop a sampling strategy, do the experiment / survey etc. Another common mistake is to confuse aims and objectives. The three bullet points above are still quite general, and might be considered as overall aims. Objectives are much more specific, and might encompass pilot studies to test methodology, or detailed studies of other variables. For example, in the butterfly study, two obvious objectives might be to see if the numbers of species of plants or the numbers of flowers \\(m^2\\)differed according to cutting regime.\nTherefore, when planning your research, a good strategy is to:\n\nScope subject area, including literature review\nDefine overall aim and the hypothesis / hypotheses you want to test\nDefine specific objectives\nPilot study (ideally) or use literature. This is useful to give you an understanding of the ‘effect size’ (more later) you are trying to detect, and thus the numbers or frequency of replicate samples that might be needed\nDesign your experiment or survey.\nUndertake your experiment or survey, keeping careful laboratory or field records.\nEnter your data into a computer (often Excel, but if using maps specialist GIS software may be better).\nImport your data into R. If needed pre-process it to make it suitable for graphing or analysis. This always takes longer than you expect. Think your analyses before you data collection to minimise pre-processing\nCreate summary tables, charts, figures. Get a broad understanding of your data.\nStatistical model of your data. Formal tests of hypotheses.\nCheck assumptions of your model. All statistical models make certain assumptions about the input data which need to be checked;\nInterpret model; if necessary modify and re-run different models and compare them. Remember: “All models are wrong, but some are useful!”\nWrite up your report (see tips below)",

Phew! One section written…)\nResults (I know what I’ve obtained from my analyses, and have created various graphs and tables to support them. Making progress, two sections written…)\nDiscussion (now I can go ahead and interpret my results in the context of existing scientific literature, discuss where it accords or contrasts with previous research, and explore possibilities for further research…)\nIntroduction (given that the rest has now been written, this is much easier to write as I know what I’m about to introduce.)\nReferences (of course, before you even begin your experiments / surveys, you need to have a good knowledge of the literature. I recommend you also use bibliographic software, such as Zotero, which automatically creates references for you)\nAbstract (a good abstract is suprisingly difficult to write. It needs to be concise, precises, and quickly communicate your findings. A good title is of course also essential.)\n\nMany scientists use the “hourglass” model as a way of thinking about how to structure scientific papers which you may have come across in Stage 1:\n\nI also particularly recommend you look at this post which describes the 5 key paragraphs of any scientific paper. It is written by an ecologist, but is actually applicable to any discipline. The same site also provides some useful tricks for clear writing.",
